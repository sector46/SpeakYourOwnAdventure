# SpeakYourOwnAdventure
A Choose Your Own Adventure application that uses voice input to change the story.

A debug version of the apk is available for download as a part of the project. A signed release version is not required 
at the moment because the app is not available on any market. Thus the latest available version of this app will be available
here.

###To use or test this app, you will need to first download the .apk file.

##To Download the .apk file (2 ways):
1) Go to https://github.com/sector46/SpeakYourOwnAdventure/blob/master/app/build/outputs/apk/app-debug.apk and 
click "view raw", which should bring up a prompt to save the file.

2) Download the entire .zip file at https://github.com/sector46/SpeakYourOwnAdventure and extract "app-debug.apk" from the
following filepath: /SpeakYourOwnAdventure-master/app/build/outputs/apk/

Now that the .apk file is on your host system, you need to transfer it to your device using a USB cable. Put it in any folder
you like, but you'll need to remember where you put it when you go to access it on your device. Navigate to the .apk file on
your device using your favorite file system manager and click on the file. A prompt should appear asking you if you want to
install the app. You'll need to follow the on-screen instructions as well as disable the security checkbox for "Unknown Sources"
(just re-enable it after you install the app). Once all on-screen instructions are followed, the app should install and be ready
to use.

##Using the app:

- To open the app, tap on the "Speak Your Own Adventure" launcher on your device.
- Start a story by tapping on the "Start" button on the startup screen.
- To advance the story, do one of two things:
    1. Press and hold the microphone (it will turn dark), then say a single verb. When done speaking, release the 
       microphone button.
    2. Tap on the textbox that says, "Say or type a single verb" and an on-screen keyboard will appear. Type a verb using the
       keyboard and tap the checkmark icon when finished.
- When you reach the end of a story, hit the back softkey on your device (standard on every Android device) and you will return
 to the startup screen.
- To view the credits for the icons, press the "Credits" button on the startup screen.
